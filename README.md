Introduction:
Uber is a transportation company with an app that allows passengers to hail a ride and drivers to charge fares and get paid. More specifically, Uber is a ridesharing company that hires independent contractors as drivers. It's one of many services today that contribute to the sharing economy, supplying a means of connecting existing resources instead of providing the physical resources themselves. The company was founded by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp in 2009, and is headquartered in San Francisco. The company has an estimated 110 million users worldwide.
